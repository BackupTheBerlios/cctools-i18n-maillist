<PRE>&gt;&gt;<i> 1) Quite a few strings are being used multiple times, so I had to
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> translate them multiple times. Is this a feature or a bug ;) ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> It's a bug.  Something that needs to be done before the 2.4 release is a
</I>&gt;<i> normalization of the strings.  I've opened an issue for that in the
</I>&gt;<i> tracker (<A HREF="http://roundup.creativecommons.org/ccpublisher/issue43">http://roundup.creativecommons.org/ccpublisher/issue43</A>).
</I>

Can Pootle assist in this? Maybe we should contact Dwayne about this, 
'cause it would be a killer feature for Pootle to find the dupes instead 
of us grepping the *.po files :)


&gt;&gt;<i> 2) Maybe its just me, but some of the English text is kinda cryptic or
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> 'doesn't feel right'. Such as:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - &quot;That identifier does not conform to the Internet Archive's naming
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> standards.&quot;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Shouldn't that be changed to this?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> - &quot;That identifier is not available.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The problem is that the first message is actually more accurate -- it
</I>&gt;<i> doesn't matter if identifiers which contain spaces, are less than 5
</I>&gt;<i> characters or more than 100 characters are available are not -- they
</I>&gt;<i> don't meet IA's naming standards.  That said, I can see how the message
</I>&gt;<i> is confusing.  Is it inaccurate to say that the identifier is
</I>&gt;<i> unavailable when it doesn't meet standards?  Do we need two different
</I>&gt;<i> messages perhaps (ie, &quot;not available&quot; and &quot;identifiers can not contain
</I>&gt;<i> ...&quot;)?
</I>
I would suggest to have two messages. It's more clear for the user what 
exactly the problem is and we can add a solution to the each specific 
error message in the documentation.


&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> BTW, how can the average ccPublisher user download a Dutch version of 
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; ccPublisher?
</I>&gt;&gt;&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; I believe the average user will have to wait for a point release that
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; includes new translations.  
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Unfortunately that is currently the case.  We're trying to do a major
</I>&gt;<i> release (i.e., 2.0, 2.2, etc) every 2-4 months and bug fix releases as
</I>&gt;<i> needed to minimize the lag, but it does exist.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> There are a couple of ideas we're looking at that will help eliminate
</I>&gt;<i> this -- one is downloaded &quot;language packs&quot; for the application
</I>&gt;<i> (downloaded by ccPublisher itself so no user intervention required, only
</I>&gt;<i> permission).
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> The other is getting the process of &quot;releasing&quot; down to a science so
</I>&gt;<i> that it's trivial to make a release.  Part of this would involve
</I>&gt;<i> starting to do nightly builds where an automated system checked out the
</I>&gt;<i> code, ran the tests and built packages, hopefully on multiple platforms.
</I>&gt;<i>  Once that was in place, providing &quot;unofficial&quot; builds with the updated
</I>&gt;<i> translations would be trivial, and new &quot;official&quot; releases on slightly
</I>&gt;<i> less so.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> So those are the two ideas we're kicking around, and we may end up doing
</I>&gt;<i> both.  Unfortunately I don't have any sort of time line for either.  If
</I>&gt;<i> you have feedback or suggestions, I'd love to hear them.
</I>
Mhhm, both solutions need some time from us -developers- to develop, so 
I would like to add a third option of creating a small howto in swapping 
*.po files so people interested in helping out can act as the &quot;automated 
system&quot; for now and distribute localized versions of ccPublisher 
independant of CC. What do you think?
