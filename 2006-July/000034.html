</I>&gt;<i> &gt; tracker (<A HREF="http://roundup.creativecommons.org/ccpublisher/issue43">http://roundup.creativecommons.org/ccpublisher/issue43</A>).
</I>&gt;<i>

</I>&gt;<i> Can Pootle assist in this? Maybe we should contact Dwayne about this,

</I>
Yes, contact him and so forth. Hopefully we can help drive their dev. We
do this on Inkscape by allowing more experimental and up and coming
projects plug easily into our world and vice-versa. We should keep
pushing bugs and features up stream to him as much as possible.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 2) Maybe its just me, but some of the English text is kinda cryptic or
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; 'doesn't feel right'. Such as:
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - &quot;That identifier does not conform to the Internet Archive's naming
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; standards.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; Shouldn't that be changed to this?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; - &quot;That identifier is not available.&quot;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The problem is that the first message is actually more accurate -- it
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; doesn't matter if identifiers which contain spaces, are less than 5
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; characters or more than 100 characters are available are not -- they
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; don't meet IA's naming standards.  That said, I can see how the message
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; is confusing.  Is it inaccurate to say that the identifier is
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; unavailable when it doesn't meet standards?  Do we need two different
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; messages perhaps (ie, &quot;not available&quot; and &quot;identifiers can not contain
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; ...&quot;)?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I would suggest to have two messages. It's more clear for the user what 
</I>&gt;<i> exactly the problem is and we can add a solution to the each specific 
</I>&gt;<i> error message in the documentation.
</I>
Yes, I agree. Simple message is good and break up the chunks that might
be re-used where possible.

&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; BTW, how can the average ccPublisher user download a Dutch version of 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ccPublisher?
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; I believe the average user will have to wait for a point release that
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; includes new translations.  
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;&gt; &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; Unfortunately that is currently the case.  We're trying to do a major
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; release (i.e., 2.0, 2.2, etc) every 2-4 months and bug fix releases as
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; needed to minimize the lag, but it does exist.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; There are a couple of ideas we're looking at that will help eliminate
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; this -- one is downloaded &quot;language packs&quot; for the application
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; (downloaded by ccPublisher itself so no user intervention required, only
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; permission).
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; The other is getting the process of &quot;releasing&quot; down to a science so
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; that it's trivial to make a release.  Part of this would involve
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; starting to do nightly builds where an automated system checked out the
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; code, ran the tests and built packages, hopefully on multiple platforms.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt;  Once that was in place, providing &quot;unofficial&quot; builds with the updated
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; translations would be trivial, and new &quot;official&quot; releases on slightly
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; less so.
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; 
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; So those are the two ideas we're kicking around, and we may end up doing
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; both.  Unfortunately I don't have any sort of time line for either.  If
</I>&gt;<i> &gt; you have feedback or suggestions, I'd love to hear them.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Mhhm, both solutions need some time from us -developers- to develop, so 
</I>&gt;<i> I would like to add a third option of creating a small howto in swapping 
</I>&gt;<i> *.po files so people interested in helping out can act as the &quot;automated 
</I>&gt;<i> system&quot; for now and distribute localized versions of ccPublisher 
</I>&gt;<i> independant of CC. What do you think?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> grtz
</I>&gt;<i> BjornW
</I>
I think best to ship with all languages included, yes setting up nightly
builds would be awesome (could use sf.net's compiler farms on diff.
architectures), and setting up ccPublisher with standard Open Source
packaging would be desirable to ease this release process.

ccHost is down to a simple:

    make dist

Which relies on a generic makefile I built for the project to deal with
packaging (which could easily be re-used) and puts RPM, tarballs,
bzip2balls, and zip packages into a packages/ folder.

The main deterrent from too often releases is getting the press release
and readme written up (and oh, the testing)...
